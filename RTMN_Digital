## Project Background

This project, "Enhancing Restaurant Marketplace: A User-Centric UI/UX Development," was undertaken during my internship with RTMN Digital. I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of this user-centric restaurant marketplace platform. Throughout the internship, I worked on frontend development, user testing, design enhancements to improve the overall user experience.

I am grateful for the valuable experience gained during my time with RTMN Digital and for the opportunity to work on this exciting project.
